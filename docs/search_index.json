Keywords {International expansion, NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, Serie A, La Liga, English Premier League, EPL,} 1.1 Professional sport leagues are racing to expand from their traditional markets, should they? Sports leagues are money making machines as evidenced by the increase in franchise values estimated by Forbes (???). The goal of any profit seeking venture is to grow as fast as possible in the short-term without sacrificing long-term profitability. As leagues look for faster growth, they naturally look to external markets to increase their potential market size. A brief look back in time shows a list of international expansion failures including the NFL withdrawing from the European continent with their development league (Keeler 2018), Formula 1 entering and exiting the US market on a semi-regular basis, MLB sporadically playing games outside the us in 1996, ’99, 2000, ’04, ’08, ’12, ’14 (Shaikin 2018). Were any of these exercises profitable, and if so, what are the factors that lead to a successful expansing? There are pockets of success which we can use to benchmark for example how soccer became such a huge international sport. Similarly, cricket is also an extremely international sport with some variations (Twenty20) in the games rules allowing for faster pace of play to attract even larger audiences. Domestic Sports leagues are currently trying multiple ways to expand internationally to monetize their product (broadcast rights, merchandise, tickets, brand). Some attempt to play off-season events in faraway lands (e.g., the National Basketball League (“NBA”), domestic soccer league soccer friendlies). Others tried to build development leagues in new markets (e.g., the NFL with the European Development League). Finally, some leagues are putting real, meaningful games outside their home markets (e.g., Major League Baseball (“MLB”) in South America and the National Hockey League (“NHL”) (Rosen 2018) and NFL (NFL 2018)targeting Sweden and the UK respectively. The purpose of this Big Idea is to understand what defines success and to build a model which can predict, based on an international market structure, what strategies a league should pursue to be successful. Specifically, we are trying to identify key success criteria by sport to maximize their chance of profitable expansion given a market structure of their target market. 1.2 What market characteristics are most encouraging to achieve to profitable market expansion. The right way to describe the problem is to is to understand what market dynamics (political, economic, social construction) make internal expansion more likely to succeed and attempt to predict the best actions or activities of leagues to maximize the potential for a positive outcome. Looking at the behavior of professional domestic league decision making, we will explore markets where Professional leagues have tried and failed (NFL development league in Europe and subsequently Germany), ongoing experiments in two classes: (1) meaningful games defined as games being played with impact on league standings (e.g., MLB, NFL, NHL) and (2) off-season games defined as games played with no impact on league standings (e.g., NBA, European national soccer league friendlies). Within these categories we will attempt to capture performance results through a variety of data sets including attendance at live events, merchandise sales outside domestic markets, international television rights valuation over time, international club membership where such official clubs exist. The analysis will ignore the investments needed to achieve any results assuming leagues behave in as rational profit seeking entities over the long-term. Instead, we will design an experiment to predict success or failure given the target market across a variety of market expansion strategies. To define market conditions will will explore the target expansion market across a variety of social, economic and political data sets. Looking at the social infrastructure we will concentrate on population growth and size of a defined target market (e.g., age, sex), and existing local sporting enthusiasms based on available market data similar to above criteria (e.g., TV licensing, merchandise sales, sport club enrollments, estimate population of to be defined criteria of being a “sports fan”). Economic data will perhaps be the most readily available from international sources including Gross Domestic Product, Disposable Income, a to-be defined middle-class identification, and population growth. Finally, we will attempt to find viable public data on the political environment as it relates to foreign company acceptance through a variety of means including, understanding trade surplus or deficit, non-sport product introduction success / failure, stability of government, political system, or general tolerance for international corporate entities. Other data points we will consider are the correlation between the national market and international expansion target market looking at number and percentage of target market players in the league which could be a barometer for youth junior program success, junior programs in target market, time zone difference between national and international target market. With this information, the aim is to build a predictive model of strategy options for leagues to maximize their expected profitability. 1.3 What is success and who will win? There are a lot of strategies tried and still in play. From the available data which to this point is predominantly in my head, we believe the following leagues in their respective markets will be successful: NHL in Europe and Eastern Asia and MLB in South America. The drivers of our predictive model that highlight these two leagues as having success is the existing target market influence of baseball and hockey respectively and the number of players already successful in the national league. The NHL will have a significant challenge similar to that faced by the NFLs expansion into London with the large time zones and distance teams need to cross for games and the corresponding impact on live game viewing opportunities to monetize through broadcast rights. However, our model predicts the leagues can compensate these challenges building on the established fan base the sport has in market. Core to all league success projections is the establishment of an existing middle class and underlying population interest in sports as we defined. One limitation of the analysis is the assumption that teams and/or leagues work in isolation. With services like SportsCenter, it seems plausible that an expansion of viewership on T.V. of one sport could complement another, but with something like game attendance, where a fan has limited resources for tickets, they may be replacements. Leagues are not working in isolation, so their interactions with one another might introduce new expansion approaches not covered in the current analysis. Given the positive results of our predictive algorithm, we see immediate applications for identifying expansion markets for national sports leagues and hope to extend the logic to other commercial business or product expansion opportunity identification experiments.

However, a day can be ruined if you are not aware of what the fish are eating or worse, don’t have the right flies in your fly box that mimics what they are eating in the correct stage of the insects life cycle. This study attempts to build a model to predict mayfly hatches based on current and recent weather patterns but also looking back to the historical weather facts to identify key points in the bugs development cycle for more accurate predictions. Trout adhere to a simple formula to survive, they hunt for the largest food source with a nutritional contribution greater than the energy expense to capture their prey. Although known to eat a wide variety of foods from ants to mice, their primary diet are insects loosely defined in 4 categories: mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), midges (Diptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera). “‘Matching the hatch’—another common term you’ll hear in fly-fishing circles—is the act of choosing the right fly and presenting it in the correct manner to fool selectively feeding trout” (Fisherman 2016). Each type of insect has it’s own special development cycle, for this initial study we will focus on mayflies and look to expand the logic to other types when successful in predicting the hatch. 2.2 Combining what we know about entomology and weather patterns, we will predict what the fish are eating up to 48 hours in advance Mayflies go through 4 distinct phases during their lifecycle. After hatching from an egg they live on the bottom of rivers as a nymph. After months or years depending on the species, they float to the surface and molt into a winged, but sexually immature, subadult called a dun (Stewart 2018). Finally free of the water the dun will again molt to their final stage unscientifically called a spinner which is the reproductive form which swarms over the water to mate, lay eggs and eventually die. Each of these stages represent a food source for trout, the nymphs underwater and during their ascension to the surface to transform into the dun are underwater. The dun phase is the picturesque moment for fly fishers where the dun is riding on the surface of the water drying its newly opened wings where one can watch fish rise and eat the tiny protein package. Finally, after the adult phase spinner reproduces, they drop to the to the water completing the cycle making for an easy food supply for trout to eat. Mayflies hatch throughout the year, but are concentrated between June - September in the northern hemisphere. With a life cycle of about 1 year, mayflies are constantly crawling/emerging (nymph), transitioning to flight (dun) and reproducing (spinner). Adding further uncertainty is a study about the impact of global warming potentially halving the life cycle (Owen, October 26, and 2011 2011) which could make knowing the timing of the hatch even more unpredictable as it varies from historical norms impacting fishermen and women, but more importantly, disrupting an important food source for the trout themselves. When it happens, and you are there, you can’t miss it. People plan entire trips to fly fishing hotspots when they expect the hatch (transition to dun) in the June/July time frame. However, being there for a week during the peak months does not guarantee you are there for a hatch. Fly fishing is almost a $1 billon industry with over $100 million spent on flies (Fly Life Magayine 2018) and looking for growth away from the historically male dominated demographics (Clarke 2017). Knowing which flies to tie or buy will help individuals save money and catch more fish, and for fly shops to sell more of the right flies to guests ensuring a more productive day on the water and, hopefully generating more repeat customers with successful visits (Perry 2014). Beyond the emotional (more fish) and commercial (more revenue) aspects, we hope this exercise will also provide a framework for further academic study on the impact of weather on insect development and life cycles. As we explore the topic of the triggers for mayfly hatches (the process of moving from a nymph to a dun and the subsequent ca. 2 days of reproduction as a spinner), the prevailing theory is environmental factors are the key driver of when mother nature hits the switch to begin the transition. Specifically, we will investigate the overall status of the waterways. The majority of documented mayfly hatches are negative investigations where researchers attempted to understand the absence of hatches. We will use this as our primary data source for water health and other environmental factors which potentially prevent or delay hatches. We will then conduct a survey of fly shops (stores and guide communities) for ongoing observational information on when large hatches occur to modify and improve our models for more accurate predictions. As mayflies are native to waterways throughout the world, we will begin our investigation in Bozeman, Montana, arguably the fly fishing capital of the US if not the world, and use these findings to predict other geographies to support or reject our models. The next hatch will begin in June or July which gives us sufficient time to begin building our historical variables and get quick feedback on the initial thinking by observation of the 2018 hatch. We will investigate water health through the following variables, we expect to have access to public data sets from fisheries and government agencies: * Water Temperature - ideal temperature for fish is below 68 F (20 C) (Shmukler 2018) * Dissolved Oxygen - oxygen is crucial to all aquatic life and insects can be an early detection system in weather health. As water temperature rises, oxygen levels decrease, but there are other manmade causes of decreased DO (Dept. Natural Resources 2018) * water flow speed (km/h) - one theory is that mayfly larva need fast flowing water, rate to be determined (Baumgardner and Bowles 2005) * water level - higher than average water levels is questioned as a potential We will investigate other environmental factors above the water looking for historical correlation to hatches or non-hatches as a predicting trigger of hatches: * cloud cover * rainfall * wind speed We hope that by using these data points over the span of the mayfly life cycle (ca. 1 year) we can triangulate the reasons for a hatch and better to understand environmental factors that will prevent or maximize the occurrence of a hatch. Finally, we will enlist the support of fly fishing shops and guides to provided survey feedback on hatch status on a daily basis through survey. We hope to tap into the general enthusiasm of the fly fishing community to learn about and protect the natural habitat that is the source of their livelihood as a motivation for supporting our study. To model the hatch, we will treat the development phases using a Markov Chain state transition model. This will allow for multivariable prediction with the outcome being a probability of development stage transition. In summary, the key data points and data sources in the initial phase represent: Data Point Time Perspective Data Source Weather Historical / Current Weather Service Water Historical / Current Weather Service Actual Hatch Current Onsite Survey Predicted Hatch Future Model 2.3 Insects entry into the food source for fish is impacted by weather, but not exclusively to determine what the fish are eating at any given time. Predicting the weather is an impossible task. Predicting a biological species reaction to weather events is adding uncertainty to the impossible. That said, although we are not able to exactly predict the event of a mayfly hatch, the results are a positive first step in identifying the core factors of mayfly development an understanding of the timing of their emergence from the nymph to the dun phase. Our conclusions that the key determinant to predict hatches is set up to 6 months before the actual date where periods of high weather changes defined as movements of more than 20 degrees C within a 10 day span will stunt the nymphs by up to 1 month against a loosely defined standard 12 month nymphal development period. Additionally, as water temperatures rise by more than 2x the historical 12 month average, within a 3 month period prior to the expected hatch will delay the ensuing hatch by up to 2 weeks. As our data points are mostly in the negative, when a hatch doesn’t occur, we expect to overlay our initial findings as we receive more scientifically captured observational feedback from the fly shop and guides of which we have less than 1 season of input. We are exploring the use of the models for both short-term predictions for immediate drop what your doing and go fish in this general area and also looking at the long-term which will allow for better planning for tourism and regional migration to areas with the highest hatch potential during a given time frame. We, as a research team, must also remain diligent to avoid a moral hazard if our models are either too predictive, or in use too much, which would route more fishermen and women to specific locations. We address this possibility for future consideration and will watch our models predictive accuracy with this in mind should it prove necessary. As we continue to refine our methodology and model, we will include other trout food species and expand our environmental data sets looking for parallels to current environmental studies on the impact of rising temperatures specifically as it relates to freshwater rivers.
